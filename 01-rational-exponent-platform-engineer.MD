## Technical & Platform Architecture Questions

### 1. **Describe your experience with building AI agent frameworks. How would you approach designing our RE:Agent platform's agentic architecture?**

**Your Answer:**
"At Walmart Global Tech, I architected and deployed multi-modal AI classification systems and built ReAct Agent-based conversational AI systems using Python, LangChain, and RAG architecture. For RE:Agent's agentic framework, I'd design a multi-layered architecture where autonomous agents can dynamically interpret regulatory requirements and translate them into actionable workflows.

My approach would involve creating specialized agents for different banking functions - compliance monitoring agents, risk assessment agents, and policy interpretation agents. Each agent would use a combination of LLMs like GPT-4o and domain-specific fine-tuned models to understand regulatory language and context. I'd implement the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern I used at Walmart, where agents can reason about regulatory requirements, plan actions, and execute compliance checks iteratively.

The key would be building a robust orchestration layer using LangChain that can coordinate between agents, maintain context across conversations, and ensure all actions are auditable and explainable - crucial for banking regulations. I'd also implement real-time monitoring using tools like MLflow for model performance and ensure the agents can adapt to new regulations through continuous learning pipelines."

### 2. **How would you implement trustworthy AI principles in a banking compliance platform like RE:Agent?**

**Your Answer:**
"Trustworthy AI in banking requires addressing explainability, fairness, robustness, and accountability. From my experience implementing multi-million dollar AI solutions at Walmart and working with regulated healthcare data at Change Healthcare, I understand these challenges intimately.

First, I'd implement explainable AI techniques using SHAP values and attention mechanisms to make every decision transparent. For RE:Agent, this means banking professionals can understand exactly why the system flagged a transaction or suggested a compliance action. Second, I'd build comprehensive bias detection and mitigation pipelines using statistical testing and fairness metrics I've used in credit assessment models.

For robustness, I'd implement ensemble methods combining traditional ML models with transformer architectures, similar to my work achieving 87% accuracy in production at Walmart.
