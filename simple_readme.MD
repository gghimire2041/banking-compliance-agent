# RE:Agent ReAct Banking Compliance System

A prototype implementation of a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) AI agent for banking compliance analysis, demonstrating systematic transaction review using iterative reasoning and action-taking patterns.

## Architecture Overview

### ReAct Agent Framework

The system implements a true ReAct architecture where the AI agent:

1. **Reasons** about compliance requirements and available information
2. **Acts** by executing specific functions to gather data or validate rules
3. **Observes** the results and incorporates them into its reasoning
4. **Iterates** through multiple reasoning-action cycles until reaching a final decision

Each transaction analysis follows this pattern:
```
Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Action → Observation → ... → Final Decision
```

### Core Components

**ReActBankingAgent Class**
- Main orchestrator implementing the reasoning loop
- Uses GPT-4 for generating reasoning and action selection
- Falls back to rule-based logic if LLM calls fail
- Maximum 10 iteration safety limit to prevent infinite loops

**Action System**
- `search_policy`: Query compliance knowledge base
- `check_customer`: Retrieve customer profile and risk ratings
- `calculate_risk`: Compute multi-factor risk scores
- `check_sanctions`: Screen entities against sanctions lists
- `validate_transaction`: Apply business rules and regulatory thresholds
- `get_historical`: Analyze customer transaction patterns
- `final_decision`: Synthesize all information into compliance determination

**Knowledge Base**
- AML policy thresholds ($10K cash reporting, $50K wire review)
- High-risk country lists (UAE, Nigeria, Myanmar, etc.)
- Sanctions screening (OFAC SDN, EU Consolidated, UN 1267)
- PEP requirements and approval workflows
- Regulatory frameworks (BSA, Patriot Act, FinCEN guidance)

**Database Schema**
- `transactions`: Core transaction data with beneficiary information
- `customers`: Customer profiles with KYC status and risk ratings
- `historical_transactions`: Pattern analysis for customer behavior

## Current Features

### Systematic Compliance Analysis

The agent performs comprehensive reviews including:
- Customer due diligence validation
- Sanctions list screening with fuzzy matching
- Multi-factor risk scoring (amount, geography, customer profile, PEP status)
- Historical pattern analysis for anomaly detection
- Regulatory threshold validation (CTR requirements, wire transfer limits)
- Business rule compliance checking

### Explainable Decision Making

Each analysis produces:
- Complete reasoning trace with timestamps
- Step-by-step thought processes in natural language
- Action parameters and execution results
- Final decision with supporting rationale
- Confidence scoring and recommendation prioritization

### Interactive Interfaces

**Command Line Interface**
- Step-by-step analysis display
- Optional detailed ReAct trace viewing
- Real-time reasoning output during analysis

**Streamlit Web Interface**
- Visual risk level indicators and metrics
- Expandable reasoning trace with JSON formatting
- Transaction selection and results dashboard
- Interactive exploration of agent decision making

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd react-banking-compliance

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Run Streamlit interface
streamlit run react_banking_system.py

# Or run command line interface
python react_banking_system.py
```

## Sample Transactions

The system includes five test scenarios:

- **TXN001**: $25K business payment (Low risk baseline)
- **TXN002**: $95K real estate purchase (Medium risk threshold testing)
- **TXN003**: $500K UAE trade with PEP (High risk, sanctions screening)
- **TXN004**: $8.5K ATM withdrawal (Low risk, cash handling)
- **TXN005**: $150K Cayman Islands investment with PEP (High risk, offshore)

## Current Limitations

### Security & Authentication
- No authentication or authorization controls
- API keys stored in environment variables without encryption
- No audit logging of user access or system modifications
- Missing role-based access controls for compliance officers vs analysts

### Data Management
- SQLite database not suitable for concurrent enterprise use
- No data encryption at rest or in transit
- Missing data retention and purging policies
- No integration with core banking systems or data warehouses

### Regulatory Compliance
- Simplified sanctions screening without real-time API integration
- Missing regulatory reporting capabilities (SAR, CTR generation)
- No integration with official OFAC, EU, or UN sanctions feeds
- Limited to US regulatory framework without multi-jurisdiction support

### Operational Reliability
- Single point of failure with no redundancy or failover
- No monitoring, alerting, or health checking
- Missing backup and disaster recovery procedures
- No performance optimization for high-volume transaction processing

### Model Governance
- No model validation, testing, or performance monitoring
- Missing bias detection and fairness testing
- No model versioning or rollback capabilities
- Limited explainability validation (reasoning quality not verified)

## Production Readiness Recommendations

### Infrastructure
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for enterprise scale
- Implement Redis for caching and session management
- Add Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling capabilities
- Establish monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging

### Security
- Integrate OAuth 2.0/SAML for enterprise authentication
- Implement API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Add secrets management with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Enable end-to-end encryption and certificate management

### Compliance & Governance
- Add comprehensive audit logging and immutable trails
- Implement model validation frameworks and A/B testing
- Create automated regulatory reporting workflows
- Establish data lineage tracking and governance policies

### Integration
- Build APIs for core banking system integration
- Connect real-time sanctions screening services
- Implement message queue processing for high-volume transactions
- Add webhook support for external compliance systems

### Operational Excellence
- Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation
- Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Create automated testing suites and deployment pipelines
- Establish incident response and escalation procedures

## FastAPI Deployment Architecture

To deploy this system using FastAPI for production API access:

### API Structure
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends, Security
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
import asyncio

app = FastAPI(title="RE:Agent Banking Compliance API")

@app.post("/analyze/{transaction_id}")
async def analyze_transaction(
    transaction_id: str,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    token: str = Security(HTTPBearer())
):
    """Analyze transaction for compliance"""
    # Implement async ReAct analysis
    result = await react_agent.analyze_transaction_async(transaction_id)
    return result

@app.get("/analysis/{analysis_id}/trace")
async def get_reasoning_trace(analysis_id: str):
    """Retrieve detailed ReAct reasoning trace"""
    return analysis_trace

@app.post("/batch-analyze")
async def batch_analyze(transaction_ids: List[str]):
    """Process multiple transactions asynchronously"""
    tasks = [analyze_single_transaction(tx_id) for tx_id in transaction_ids]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```

### Deployment Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/compliance
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
  
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: compliance
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

### Key FastAPI Enhancements
- Async transaction processing for high throughput
- Background task queues for long-running analyses
- WebSocket support for real-time reasoning trace streaming
- OpenAPI documentation with compliance-specific schemas
- Health checks and metrics endpoints for monitoring
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access controls

This FastAPI deployment would transform the current prototype into a scalable, production-ready compliance analysis service suitable for integration into enterprise banking infrastructure.
