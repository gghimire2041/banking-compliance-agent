# Transforming Business Operations Through AI: Two Strategic Projects at Walmart

## Executive Summary

During my tenure at Walmart Global Tech, I led the development of two mission-critical AI systems that transformed manual, time-intensive business processes into intelligent, automated solutions. These projects delivered multi-million dollar cost savings while establishing new standards for how AI can enhance decision-making in complex enterprise environments.

## Project 1: Intelligent Claims Classification System
**Revolutionizing Risk Assessment Through Multi-Modal AI**

### The Challenge
Walmart processes thousands of claims daily from employees and customers who experience incidents while shopping or working. The traditional approach required human adjusters to manually evaluate each claim, determine severity levels, and route cases to appropriate officers—a process that was slow, inconsistent, and prone to human bias.

### The Solution
I architected and deployed a sophisticated multi-modal AI classification system that transformed this manual bottleneck into an intelligent, automated workflow.

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Integrated BERT, Llama 2/3, and GPT-4o to analyze diverse claim data including incident reports, images, and structured forms
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combined traditional NLP with Transformer models using PyTorch and TensorFlow
- **Production Excellence**: Achieved 87% accuracy in production environment with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Implementation Approach:**
- Built comprehensive data pipelines to process structured and unstructured claim information
- Implemented ensemble learning techniques to leverage strengths of different model architectures
- Established MLOps best practices with automated model monitoring and performance tracking
- Created explainable AI components to provide transparent reasoning for classification decisions

### Business Impact
- **Multi-million dollar cost savings** through automated claim processing and optimized resource allocation
- **Dramatic reduction** in processing time from days to minutes
- **Improved consistency** in claim severity assessment across all business units
- **Enhanced risk management** through early identification of high-severity incidents

### Key Technical Achievements
- Successfully deployed production-ready AI system handling high-volume, business-critical decisions
- Demonstrated expertise in combining multiple AI architectures for optimal performance
- Established scalable MLOps infrastructure supporting continuous model improvement
- Built explainable AI capabilities essential for business stakeholder confidence

## Project 2: Unified Conversational Analytics Platform
**Democratizing Business Intelligence Through Natural Language AI**

### The Challenge
Walmart's global business intelligence was fragmented across multiple systems—separate Power BI models for Walmart US, Sam's Club, International operations, and P&L data. Business stakeholders struggled to get comprehensive insights, often requiring technical expertise to navigate complex dashboards and query structured data effectively.

### The Solution
I developed a groundbreaking conversational analytics system that unified disparate data sources into a single, natural language interface, making complex business intelligence accessible to all stakeholders.

**Technical Architecture:**
- **FastAPI Backend**: Built high-performance REST API infrastructure for seamless integration
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Connected four major Power BI semantic models into unified query interface
- **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: Implemented Milvus-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation to query unstructured business documents
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Deployed ReAct agents to intelligently route queries between structured and unstructured data sources

**Innovation Highlights:**
- **Semantic Model Unification**: Created abstraction layer allowing cross-business-unit queries through natural language
- **Hybrid Data Architecture**: Seamlessly combined structured database queries with document-based knowledge retrieval
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Built intelligent agent system that determines optimal data source based on query intent
- **Scalable Design**: Architected system to handle queries across global business units with consistent performance

### Business Impact
- **Democratized access** to business intelligence across all organizational levels
- **Accelerated decision-making** by eliminating technical barriers to data insights
- **Improved cross-functional collaboration** through unified view of global operations
- **Enhanced data literacy** by making complex analytics accessible through conversational interface

### Technical Excellence
- **Production-Ready System**: Deployed robust FastAPI infrastructure handling enterprise-scale queries
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Successfully orchestrated multiple AI components (RAG, semantic models, ReAct agents)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built system supporting multiple business units with room for expansion
- **User-Centric Design**: Created intuitive natural language interface requiring no technical training

## Cross-Project Technical Leadership

### MLOps and Production Excellence
Both projects demonstrate mastery of enterprise AI deployment:
- Established comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems
- Implemented automated model validation and performance tracking
- Built robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Created detailed audit trails for business compliance requirements

### Team Leadership and Collaboration
- **Cross-functional leadership**: Led team of 6+ data scientists across diverse AI architectures
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Successfully translated complex AI capabilities into business value for C-level executives
- **Knowledge transfer**: Established documentation and training programs for sustainable system maintenance

### Innovation and Problem-Solving
- **First-principles thinking**: Approached each challenge by fundamentally reimagining existing workflows
- **Pragmatic implementation**: Balanced cutting-edge AI techniques with reliable production requirements
- **Business-focused solutions**: Ensured every technical decision directly supported measurable business outcomes

## Key Takeaways

These projects illustrate my ability to:

1. **Transform manual processes** into intelligent, automated systems that deliver measurable business value
2. **Architect complex AI systems** that seamlessly integrate multiple technologies and data sources
3. **Lead cross-functional teams** to deliver production-ready solutions in enterprise environments
4. **Bridge technical complexity** with business stakeholder needs through clear communication and user-focused design
5. **Establish scalable infrastructure** that supports current needs while enabling future growth

Both systems continue to operate in production, delivering ongoing value and serving as foundational platforms for additional AI initiatives across Walmart's global operations.
